# Bond and me #

On 31.12.2020 I adopted Bond, my amazing little Boston Terrier. From the first day on I gave him the nickname Puppers and called him that ever since.

After the first week of constant monitoring I realized that there should be an app that helps me keep track of his peeing cycles to avoid accidents in the apartment. Since I couldn't find any that I liked, I just created one and used it everyday.


# The Puppers app #

Raise a healthy pupper by keeping track of his eating, drinking, poo & pee rythm. Always know when it's time to go out to make house breaking easier.
This is the initial release, there's still a lot to do. 

Exciting upcoming future updates:

* Individual Machine Learning to accurately predict when your dog needs to go out
* support sounds to train right with your phone
* Breed specific dog raising information
* much much more
